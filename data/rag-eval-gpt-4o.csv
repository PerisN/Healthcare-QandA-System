"If you are experiencing persistent symptoms after adopting a strict gluten-free diet for celiac disease, consider the following steps:

1. Ensure that you are truly adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms and damage. Look for hidden sources of gluten in foods such as additives made with wheat, like modified food starch, preservatives, and stabilizers. It's also important to check non-food items like medications, vitamins, supplements, cosmetics, and personal care products which might contain gluten.

2. Consult with a dietitian who specializes in celiac disease to help you identify and eliminate potential hidden sources of gluten from your diet.

3. Consider other conditions that may mimic celiac symptoms, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, microscopic colitis, IBS, lactose intolerance, and other food intolerances. Discuss these possibilities with your healthcare provider.

4. If your symptoms continue and no hidden gluten sources are identified, you may need to evaluate for refractory celiac disease, a rare condition where the intestines cannot heal. This condition might require specialized treatment, such as receiving nutrients intravenously.

Additionally, new treatments, such as high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, are being tested in clinical trials. Each child's treatment plan should be carefully developed by a team of healthcare providers who specialize in treating such conditions. Children with these tumors may also participate in clinical trials before, during, or after their standard treatment to potentially receive new therapies. Follow-up tests might be necessary to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and check for recurrence.",97970ba7,What are the standard treatments available for childhood brain and spinal cord tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the standard treatments for childhood brain and spinal cord tumors, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
