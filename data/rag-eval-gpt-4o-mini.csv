1. **Surgery**: Used to diagnose and remove tumors.
2. **Radiation Therapy**: High-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells or prevent their growth.
3. **Chemotherapy**: Drugs are used to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing them or preventing them from dividing.
4. **High-dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue**: Involves giving high doses of chemotherapy followed by the replacement of blood-forming cells.

Additionally, new types of treatments are being tested in clinical trials, and patients may consider participating in these trials before, during, or after their standard treatment.",97970ba7,What are the standard treatments available for childhood brain and spinal cord tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by listing the standard treatments for childhood brain and spinal cord tumors, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. It also mentions the option of clinical trials, which is pertinent to standard treatment discussions."
"Controlling high blood pressure can help decrease the risk of thrombocythemia complications because high blood pressure can contribute to the development of blood clots. By managing blood pressure levels, you can reduce the likelihood of these clots forming, which is especially important for individuals with thrombocythemia, as they already have an increased risk for complications related to elevated platelet counts, such as blood clot formation.",4ffeb1b3,How does controlling high blood pressure contribute to decreasing my risk of thrombocythemia complications?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by explaining how controlling high blood pressure helps decrease the risk of complications associated with thrombocythemia, particularly in relation to blood clot formation. It effectively connects high blood pressure management with reducing risks for individuals at an increased risk due to elevated platelet counts."
